## Neural Network v1\.0\.4


</div>

### Description

Neural networks (NN) emulate the thinking process of the human brain, including the ability to "learn". Many applications exsist for NN's, most popular of which is video games. This is a complete NN "Engine", all nicely packaged into one class module.

<BR>

<BR><BR>v1.0.2: Some optimization and NN saving.

<BR><BR>v1.0.3: Actually made the NN export work (:Þ) and added NNImport. Toyed around a bit with Memory Banks, but have put them off in the background for now.

<BR><BR>v1.0.4: Added Noise and Momentum factors. Noise is useful for a small sample of scalar data, while momentum prevents drastic changes when training as well as promoating continued change in the right direction.

<BR><BR>Also see my chess program that uses this class. (Not yet updated with v1.0.4... on its way...)

<BR><BR>Just also want to say that this work is heavly based off of the work by Ulli. His code used to be available here on PSC, but I don't know what happened to it.
 
### More Info
 
NN's are inheritly slow, and the more you want it capable of doing, the larger and slower it will be. Although a NN may be capable of being all you need as a Game AI, coupling it with another, faster algorythm may be benificial (like the A* pathing algorythm or alpha-beta method.)

In theory, with a large enough and powerful enough computer, one may be able to create artificial life... ie: The Terminator/Matrix. <BR>Enjoy.
